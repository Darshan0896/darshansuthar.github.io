I approach analytics problems using a structured workflow:

**Business Framing → Data Audit → Analysis → Prediction → Decision**

My focus is on solving real business problems using data, not just building models.

**Tools:** Python, SQL, MySQL, Tableau  
**Domains:** Business, Finance, Markets, Security Analytics
